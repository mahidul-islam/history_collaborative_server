In busy modern life we (as Muslims) are involved in so many things, we tend to forget about the real purpose of our lives. we tend to forget that we are the Representative of Allah. We have the responsibility of purging the darkness as Prophet ﷺ cleaned the worst of darkness from the whole world. We (the Ummah) bear the responsibility as a whole to make the world peaceful and safe for all souls.

So as a precondition we need to know what Prophet Muhammad ﷺ had done to create the Golden era of Humanity. let us know the root of our existence. let us know our own pride.
